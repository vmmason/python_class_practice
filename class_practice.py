#Object Oriented Programming Practice from Corey Schafer's YT Videos

#A class is a blueprint for creating instances
class Employee:
    pass

emp_1 = Employee()
emp_2 = Employee()
#Each of these variables are instances of the Employee() class with unique locations in memory.

emp_1.first = "Veron"
emp_1.last = "Mason"
emp_1.email = "veronmmason@gmail.com"
emp_1.astrology = "Sagittarius"
